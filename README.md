# BdPOnlineMap

This is a project to organize and visualize international camps, and projects, as well as existing contacts through partnerships or similar things in the BdP.
It aims to 1. give an easier access to knowledge about international work to all members of the BdP
           2. help reducing redundant work done in several places of the BdP at the same time
           3. give a more transparent overview of the work of the working group for international scouting in the BdP
