# BdPOnlineMap

This is a project to organize and visualize international camps, and projects, as well as existing contacts through partnerships or similar things in the BdP.
It aims to 1. give an easier access to knowledge about international work to all members of the BdP
           2. help reducing redundant work done in several places of the BdP at the same time
           3. give a more transparent overview of the work of the working group for international scouting in the BdP


Current ToDos:
	* enable cancelling view	
	* identifying proper online database to load markers from 
		- content should be easily manageable (file format and writing/making changes into)
		- should be quick and uncomplicated in loading
		- should fulfill certain level of data security (even though most of its content will be published on the web, anyway?!)
		- google.docs? limesurvey-database? what else?
	* loading from online database (not .csv)
		- quick, clean and secure
	* updating online database
		- identify proper structure for each category
		- fill with decent information / links / media
		- find proper marker icons
	* make website available for mobile devices
		- why is it not working currently?
		- make page responsive (and clear - maybe popup of info-box, instead of fixed position?)
	* make AK-information-box
		- what should be in there?
		- need additional structure?
		- how to update it?
	* implementation somewhere?
		- hosting as pfadfinden.de content?
		- on pfa.de?
	* ensure Group-info-actuality:
		- add date-info of submission to each groups information
		- include XY-years of data validity - if older, do not display (and automatically send Email to ask for update)
	* include camp / activity data:
		- enable filtering for dates (this year, next year, always, ...)
		- show only future things, not past (but activatable)
		- get drop-down menu to choose those menus
	* enable merging points when zoom is far out
	* include others
		- who else wants to contribute? (advertisement, project-description)
